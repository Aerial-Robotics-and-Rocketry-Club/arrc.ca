								<span class="image main"><img src="images/abot.webp" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									The Aerial Robotics & Rocketry Club, founded in 2015 by Blago and Ilija Hristovski at UBC's Okanagan campus, has been a pioneer in creating aerospace opportunities for students. Initially, options for pursuing aerospace engineering were limited, but the club has transformed this landscape by providing a dynamic environment for students to explore their passions. Thanks to the club and its supporters, "aerospace" is now a prominent topic at UBC‚Äôs Okanagan campus.<br>
									<br>Open to students from all faculties‚Äîincluding Engineering, Science, Computer Science, Creative and Critical Studies, and Management‚Äîthe club meets weekly to focus on developing innovative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), rockets, FPV-flying, fixed wing aircrafts. For the 2023/2024 season, we aim to advance our divisions and excel in upcoming competitions.<br>
									<br>The club also hosts a variety of events including industry nights, learning workshops, and social events. There is always a need for student volunteers with a passion for aerospace and a strong work ethic at Aerial Robotics and Rocketry Club. Whether you want to design and build aircraft, plan and coordinate events, or learn more about the aerospace industry, please feel free to come to the club meetings. You can check our website for upcoming events or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us! <br>
									<br>We look forward to having you onboard! <br>
									~ Gurkirat Singh Dhamija, Club President

									<h3>Competition & Rocketry Divisions</h3>
									<p>
										Rocketry has quickly become a new and engaging division within the UBCO Aerospace Club. We are currently working on a propulsion system for sounding rockets, with the purpose of atmospheric science research.<br>
										<br>The Rocketry Division is highly encouraged for first years and is always welcoming new members.<br>
										<br> Previous projects include the 'SLR', landing an ~8ft rocket under its own propulsion which required a number of members each with diverse backgrounds, no matter the experience.<br>
										<br> We look forward to advertising our upcoming projects and encourage engagement of all backgrounds. <br>
										<br> We also love to test our regular 7ft Rocket for practice, and for new members to get involved right away! Come work with us, and explore your passion for Rocketry.<br>
